# Deployment Test

Testing credential manager fix for AWS temporary credentials.

Date: 2025-09-18
Issue: Images not loading due to credential manager not reinitializing
Fix: Added updateConfiguration() call in settings controller

Expected result: Images should load after temporary credentials are saved.
