# 🚀 How I Built a Complete CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and Docker for My Blog Project

*A comprehensive guide to containerizing and automating your web application deployment*

---

## Why This Matters

In today's fast-paced development environment, manual deployments are not just inefficient—they're risky. After struggling with inconsistent deployments and environment issues on my blog project, I decided to build a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. Here's how I did it and what I learned.

## The Challenge

My blog project consists of:
- **Frontend**: React application built with Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js Express API
- **Database**: Aiven MySQL (cloud-hosted)
- **Infrastructure**: Linux server with Docker

The main challenges were:
- Ensuring consistent deployments across environments
- Managing HTTPS certificates and SSL termination
- Automating testing and deployment workflows
- Handling secrets and environment variables securely

## The Solution: Jenkins + Docker Pipeline

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

I built a multi-stage pipeline that:
1. **Builds** both frontend and backend containers
2. **Tests** containers individually and together
3. **Deploys** to production with HTTPS support
4. **Monitors** health checks and rollback capabilities

**Key Components:**
- **Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline**: Automatically discovers and builds all branches
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates multi-container testing
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Handles SSL termination and routing
- **GitHub Container Registry**: Stores production-ready images
- **Let's Encrypt SSL**: Provides HTTPS certificates

### 🔧 Pipeline Stages Breakdown

#### Stage 1: Build & Test with Docker Compose
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml excerpt
version: '3.8'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./client
    ports: ["3000:80", "3443:443"]
    environment:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://bapi.ingasti.com
    depends_on: [backend]
  
  backend:
    build: ./api
    ports: ["5000:5000"]
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
      - CORS_ORIGIN=https://blog.ingasti.com
```

#### Stage 2: Individual Container Testing
The pipeline tests each container separately to ensure they work in isolation before testing integration.

#### Stage 3: Production Deployment
For main/master branches, the pipeline:
- Pushes images to GitHub Container Registry
- Deploys containers with SSL certificates
- Configures Nginx reverse proxy
- Performs health checks on HTTPS endpoints

### 🔐 Security & HTTPS Implementation

One of the biggest challenges was implementing proper HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificates:

**Frontend Container (Nginx)**:
- Serves React app on HTTPS (port 443)
- Redirects HTTP to HTTPS automatically
- Mounts Let's Encrypt certificates as volumes

**Backend API**:
- Runs HTTP internally (port 5000)
- Protected by Nginx reverse proxy
- CORS configured for HTTPS origins only

**Host Nginx Configuration**:
```nginx
# Frontend proxy (blog.ingasti.com)
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name blog.ingasti.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/ingasti.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ingasti.com/privkey.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### 📊 Key Metrics & Results

**Before CI/CD Pipeline:**
- ⏱️ Manual deployment time: 30-45 minutes
- 🐛 Deployment errors: ~20% of deployments
- 🔄 Rollback time: 15-20 minutes
- 😰 Stress level: High

**After CI/CD Pipeline:**
- ⏱️ Automated deployment time: 5-8 minutes
- 🐛 Deployment errors: <2% (mostly infrastructure issues)
- 🔄 Rollback time: 2-3 minutes
- 😌 Stress level: Much lower!

## Key Learnings & Best Practices

### 🎯 What Worked Well

1. **Multibranch Pipeline**: Automatically builds all branches, deploys only main/master
2. **Health Checks**: Both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints tested during deployment
3. **Secrets Management**: All sensitive data stored in Jenkins credentials
4. **SSL Automation**: Let's Encrypt certificates automatically mounted in containers
5. **Port Strategy**: Different ports for testing vs production to avoid conflicts

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Docker Permissions**: Ensure Jenkins user is in docker group (`usermod -aG docker jenkins`)
2. **Certificate Mounting**: Use absolute paths for SSL certificate volumes
3. **CORS Configuration**: Update backend to allow production HTTPS origins
4. **Health Check Timeouts**: Give containers enough time to start (30-60 seconds)
5. **Registry Authentication**: Ensure GitHub token has package write permissions

### 🔧 Jenkins Configuration Essentials

**Required Credentials:**
- `github-credentials`: Repository access (username + token)
- `database-url`: MySQL connection string
- `jwt-secret`: JWT signing secret
- `github-user` & `github-token`: Container registry access

**Plugin Requirements:**
- Pipeline plugin
- Multibranch Pipeline plugin
- GitHub plugin
- Credentials Binding plugin

## The Jenkinsfile Structure

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    environment {
        COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME = "blog-${env.BRANCH_NAME}-${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
        IMAGE_TAG = "${env.BRANCH_NAME}-${env.BUILD_NUMBER}-${env.GIT_COMMIT.take(7)}"
        REGISTRY = 'ghcr.io/yourusername/your-blog-repo'
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Build & Test Docker Compose') {
            steps {
                script {
                    withCredentials([
                        string(credentialsId: 'database-url', variable: 'DATABASE_URL'),
                        string(credentialsId: 'jwt-secret', variable: 'JWT_SECRET')
                    ]) {
                        sh '''
                            export CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"
                            export NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:5000"
                            docker compose up --build -d
                        '''
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Additional stages for testing, deployment, etc.
    }
}
```

## Impact on Development Workflow
