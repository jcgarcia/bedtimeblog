# Sprint Log â€“ August 29, 2025

## Previous Attempt: Issues Summary
- Social features (likes, sharing, comments) were added, but backend failed due to missing/misconfigured files (e.g., auth.js middleware).
- Backend container startup failed due to missing modules and incompatible imports.
- Frontend build passed, but single post view was broken (blank page).
- Reverting files did not match the exact working commit, causing persistent issues.
- Recovery steps and documentation were incomplete.

## Current Plan
- Document every change and update sprint log for each step.
- Create backup before new changes.
- Add social features incrementally, testing after each step.
- Ensure single post view and all existing features remain functional.
- Restore from backup if any issue arises.

## Progress Log

### 1. Backup Created
All key files were backed up to `activity/backup` before any changes.
Restore from this backup if needed.

### 2. Social Features Implementation Started
- Backend setup for likes feature:
  - Created migration: `api/migrations/2025-08-29-add-post-likes.sql`
  - Added backend route: `api/routes/likes.js`
  - Added controller: `api/controllers/likes.js`
  - Registered route in `api/index.js`
- Next: Frontend integration for likes

### 3. Likes Feature Implementation
- Backend: Migration, route, controller for post likes created and registered.
- Frontend: Integrated likes UI and logic in `singlePost.jsx`.
  - Displays like count for each post.
  - Allows logged-in users to like/unlike posts.
  - Calls backend API to update like status and count.
