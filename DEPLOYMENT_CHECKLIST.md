## üîß Deployment Commands

### Build and Push Images
```bash
# Build backend
cd api
docker build -f Dockerfile.k8s -t localhost:5000/blog-backend:latest .
docker push localhost:5000/blog-backend:latest

# Build frontend
cd ../client
docker build -f Dockerfile.k8s -t localhost:5000/blog-frontend:latest .
docker push localhost:5000/blog-frontend:latest
```

### Deploy to Kubernetes
```bash
# Deploy using script
cd k8s
./deploy.sh

# Or deploy manually
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f storage.yaml
kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
```

### Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check pods
kubectl get pods -n blog

# Check services
kubectl get svc -n blog

# Check ingress
kubectl get ingress -n blog

# Test health endpoints
curl -f https://bapi.ingasti.com/health
curl -f https://blog.ingasti.com/health
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Deployment
```bash
# Rollback backend
kubectl rollout undo deployment/blog-backend -n blog

# Rollback frontend
kubectl rollout undo deployment/blog-frontend -n blog

# Check rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment/blog-backend -n blog
kubectl rollout status deployment/blog-frontend -n blog
```

### Scale Down for Maintenance
```bash
# Scale to 0 replicas
kubectl scale deployment blog-backend --replicas=0 -n blog
kubectl scale deployment blog-frontend --replicas=0 -n blog

# Scale back up
kubectl scale deployment blog-backend --replicas=2 -n blog
kubectl scale deployment blog-frontend --replicas=2 -n blog
```

### Debug Pod Issues
```bash
# Describe problematic pods
kubectl describe pods -n blog

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/blog-backend -n blog
kubectl logs -f deployment/blog-frontend -n blog

# Get shell access
kubectl exec -it deployment/blog-backend -n blog -- /bin/sh
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Resource Usage
```bash
# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -n blog
kubectl top nodes

# Check HPA status
kubectl get hpa -n blog
```

### Application Metrics
```bash
# Backend health and metrics
curl -s https://bapi.ingasti.com/health | jq .

# Frontend health
curl -s https://blog.ingasti.com/health
```
