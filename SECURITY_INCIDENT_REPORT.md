# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Security Breach Detected

**CRITICAL**: Production secrets have been exposed in the public GitHub repository!

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. ROTATE ALL CREDENTIALS IMMEDIATELY

**Database Credentials:**
- [ ] Change database password in Aiven dashboard
- [ ] Update connection strings everywhere
- [ ] Revoke old credentials

**API Keys:**
- [ ] Regenerate all API keys
- [ ] Update production deployments
- [ ] Invalidate old keys

**JWT Secret:**
- [ ] Generate new JWT secret
- [ ] Update production environment
- [ ] Invalidate all existing tokens (forces re-login)

### 2. REMOVE SECRETS FROM REPOSITORY

**Files to Delete/Fix:**
- [ ] `api/.env` - DELETE completely
- [ ] `tools/.env.local` - DELETE completely  
- [ ] `k8s/blog-secrets.yaml` - Replace with template

### 3. AUDIT AND MONITORING

**Check for Compromise:**
- [ ] Review database access logs
- [ ] Check for unauthorized API usage
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Review recent deployments

### 4. SECURITY HARDENING

**Prevent Future Exposure:**
- [ ] Add proper .gitignore rules
- [ ] Use environment variables only
- [ ] Implement secrets management
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks

## Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK EXPOSURE:**
- Full database access credentials
- Production API keys
- JWT signing secrets
- Kubernetes deployment secrets

**Potential Impact:**
- Database compromise
- Unauthorized API access
- Token forgery
- Data breach

**Affected Systems:**
- Production database
- API endpoints
- User authentication
- Kubernetes cluster

## Recovery Steps

1. **Immediate Credential Rotation**
2. **Security Audit**
3. **Repository Cleanup** 
4. **Monitoring Setup**
5. **Security Training**
