# Test Upload from Script

This is a test post to verify that the `blog-publish.js` script is still working correctly.

## Features Tested

- Frontmatter parsing
- File upload functionality
- API endpoint communication
- Authentication via API key

The script should successfully upload this post and return a success message with post details.
