# Database Connection Management Improvements

## Summary of Changes Made

We've identified and fixed several critical issues with database connection management in your Bedtime Blog project that were causing idle connections to persist and drain your PostgreSQL connection pool.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Database Pool Configuration** (`api/db.js`)
**Problem**: The original pool configuration had no limits or timeouts, leading to connections staying open indefinitely.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added proper connection pool configuration with limits
- Set maximum connections to 20 and minimum to 2
- Configured idle timeout (30 seconds) and connection timeout (10 seconds)
- Added graceful shutdown handling
- Added pool error handling and optional debug logging

### 2. **Controller Functions** (`api/controllers/*.js`)
**Problem**: All controller functions used async IIFE wrappers and callback-style JWT verification, creating unnecessary complexity and potential memory leaks.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Converted all functions to proper async/await pattern
- Removed unnecessary async IIFE wrappers
- Improved error handling with proper logging
- Fixed JWT verification to use promises instead of callbacks

### 3. **System Configuration Manager** (`api/utils/systemConfig.js`)
**Problem**: Database connections weren't always properly released in error scenarios.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added proper try-finally blocks for connection release
- Improved error handling to prevent audit failures from breaking operations
- Added connection cleanup in error paths

### 4. **Middleware Improvements** (`api/middleware/systemConfig.js`)
**Problem**: System configuration loading could fail and stop request processing.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added fallback configurations when database is unavailable
- Improved error handling to continue with defaults rather than failing requests
- Added proper error catching for individual config items

### 5. **Server Graceful Shutdown** (`api/index.js`)
**Problem**: No graceful shutdown handling, connections remained open on server restart.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added SIGTERM and SIGINT signal handlers
- Implemented graceful shutdown with database pool cleanup
- Added timeout for forced shutdown if graceful shutdown fails

### 6. **File Upload Error Handling** (`api/controllers/publish.js`)
**Problem**: Uploaded files weren't cleaned up in error scenarios.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added proper file cleanup in try-catch blocks
- Improved error handling for file operations

## New Features Added

### 1. **Database Health Check Utility** (`api/utils/dbHealthCheck.js`)
- Real-time connection pool monitoring
- Database connectivity testing
- Detailed connection information endpoint
- Idle connection termination utility

### 2. **Health Check Endpoints**
- `/health` - Basic application health
- `/health/db` - Database connectivity and pool stats
- `/health/db/connections` - Detailed connection information

## Configuration Parameters

The new pool configuration includes:

```javascript
{
  max: 20,                    // Maximum connections
  min: 2,                     // Minimum connections to keep alive
  idle: 10000,               // Close after 10s inactivity
  acquire: 60000,            // Max time to get connection
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 10000,  // Connection timeout
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,       // Idle connection timeout
  allowExitOnIdle: true           // Allow graceful shutdown
}
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Pool Statistics Logging
In development mode, pool statistics are logged every 30 seconds:
```
DB Pool Stats: Total: 5, Idle: 3, Waiting: 0
```

### Health Check Endpoints
Monitor your database connections:
```bash
# Basic health check
curl https://your-api/health/db

# Detailed connection info
curl https://your-api/health/db/connections
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Single Pool Instance**: Using singleton pattern to prevent multiple pools
2. **Proper Error Handling**: All database operations now have proper error handling
3. **Connection Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on server shutdown
4. **Resource Management**: Proper file cleanup in upload operations
5. **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and connection monitoring

## Expected Results

After these changes, you should see:

1. **Reduced Idle Connections**: Connections will be automatically closed after 30 seconds of inactivity
2. **Better Resource Management**: Maximum of 20 connections with proper cleanup
3. **Improved Stability**: Graceful shutdown prevents orphaned connections
4. **Better Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into connection usage
5. **Error Recovery**: System continues to work even when individual operations fail

## Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all PostgreSQL environment variables are properly set
2. **Monitoring**: Use the new health check endpoints to monitor connection health
3. **Graceful Restarts**: The server now properly closes connections on restart
4. **Resource Limits**: Consider adjusting pool limits based on your database server capacity

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test the health check endpoints after deployment
2. Monitor the pool statistics during peak usage
3. Verify that connections are properly closed after idle timeout
4. Test graceful shutdown by sending SIGTERM to the process

The publishing system should now work reliably without connection leaks or idle connection buildup.
