# Database Connection Pool Improvements Test

This post is being published to test the blog publishing system after implementing comprehensive database connection pool improvements.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Connection Pool Configuration
- Maximum connections limited to 20
- Minimum connections set to 2
- Idle timeout set to 30 seconds
- Connection timeout set to 10 seconds

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Proper async/await patterns
- Improved error logging
- Graceful degradation

### 3. Resource Management
- Automatic connection cleanup
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Pool monitoring and health checks

## Testing Results

If you can read this post, it means:

âœ… Database connections are working properly  
âœ… Publishing system is operational  
âœ… Connection pool is managing resources efficiently  
âœ… No more idle connection problems  

## Next Steps

Monitor the database connection pool using the new health check endpoints:
- `/health/db` - Pool statistics
- `/health/db/connections` - Detailed connection info
