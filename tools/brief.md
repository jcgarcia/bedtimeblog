# 🚧 𝗚𝗶𝘁𝗛𝘂𝗯 𝗖𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘁: 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀 & 𝗡𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀 🚧

## 🔍 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗜𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲
The backend API is still not exposing the required publishing endpoints (`/api/publish/markdown`) on the cloud server, despite correct code and redeployment.

### ⚠️ 𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿
Confirming the backend container is running the latest image with all required environment variables. The publishing tool cannot be fully tested until the backend API is reachable.

## 🛠️ 𝗡𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀
1. Verify backend container/image and environment variables.
2. Ensure the backend exposes the correct endpoints.
3. Test publishing and document the process and results.

## 📅 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲
- Jenkins pipeline is fully automated: checks out code, builds Docker images, pushes to registry, deploys to Kubernetes, and verifies deployments.
- Secure secret handling is in place.
- Kubernetes deployments and health checks are automated.
- Backend and frontend images are built and deployed with correct tags and environment variables.

## 🚫 𝗦𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱
- Backend API (`https://bapi.ingasti.com/api/publish/markdown` and `/health`) returns 404 errors.
- Publishing tool cannot complete its workflow.
- Backend is running, but API routes are not exposed or reachable from outside the cluster.

## 🔍 𝗥𝗼𝗼𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲
- Backend container is running, but API routes are not exposed correctly to the public endpoint.
- Possible causes:
  - Misconfigured Kubernetes service/ingress
  - Incorrect backend port/path
  - Network/firewall rules blocking access

## ✅ 𝗧𝗼 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗵
- Direct access to Kubernetes cluster to debug service/ingress and pod logs.
- Verify and fix Kubernetes service/ingress to expose `/api/publish/markdown` and `/health`.
- Once reachable, publishing tool should work end-to-end.

## 📌 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆
Automation, security, and deployment pipeline are complete. The only blocker is backend API exposure—an infrastructure issue, not a code problem. Once resolved, the system will be fully operational.
