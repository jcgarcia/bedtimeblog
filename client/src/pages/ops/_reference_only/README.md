# OpsPanelFull.jsx - DEPRECATED FILE

**üö® DO NOT USE THIS FILE IN PRODUCTION! üö®**

This file contains the **OLD MONOLITHIC VERSION** of the operations panel from before we split it into functional components.

## Current Production Architecture (CORRECT)
- **Main File**: `Ops.jsx` (capital O)
- **Components**: Individual functional components in `/components/` directory:
  - ContentManagement.jsx
  - MediaManagement.jsx
  - UserManagement.jsx
  - SocialMediaManagement.jsx
  - SiteSettings.jsx
  - Analytics.jsx
  - PageManagement.jsx
  - CognitoAdminPanel.jsx

## Why This File Exists
- **Reference Only**: Contains original code for feature reference
- **Historical Record**: Shows how functionality was originally implemented
- **Code Mining**: Source for extracting specific features if needed

## If You Use This File In Production
- ‚ùå You will lose ALL current functional components
- ‚ùå You will lose upload functionality 
- ‚ùå You will lose draft management
- ‚ùå You will lose recent improvements and fixes
- ‚ùå You will break the component-based architecture

## What To Do Instead
1. Always use `Ops.jsx` (capital O) as the main operations panel
2. Modify individual components in `/components/` directory
3. If you need functionality from this file, extract it and add it to the appropriate component
4. Never import or reference this file in production code
