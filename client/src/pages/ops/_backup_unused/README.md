# Backup of Unused Components

This directory contains React components that are no longer in use but kept for reference:

## OpsPanelFull.jsx
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - Do not use
- **Reason**: Old unified panel implementation that was replaced by modular approach
- **Warning**: Using this component would "create a BIG MESS" as mentioned by user
- **Replacement**: Use Ops.jsx with ContentManagement.jsx instead

## PostManagement.jsx  
- **Status**: UNUSED - Was modified but never actually imported/used
- **Reason**: Thought to be main posts component but actual component is ContentManagement.jsx
- **Issue**: Multiple deployment attempts failed because this component wasn't being rendered
- **Replacement**: ContentManagement.jsx handles posts section

## Notes
- These files were moved here to prevent future confusion
- Always verify which components are actually being imported and rendered
- Check component hierarchy: Ops.jsx → ContentManagement.jsx → posts/categories sections
